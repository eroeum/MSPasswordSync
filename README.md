# MSPasswordSync

When a Microsoft password is changed for a non-local account, the password does not sync automatically and requires a forced refresh in order to log into your Microsoft account remotely (such as via RDP).

This will force a refresh sync for the Microsoft account.

To use, simply double click the `MSPasswordSync.bat` file.
